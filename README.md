What's forking?

Forking is a git clone operation executed on a server copy of a projects repo. ... You create a new feature branch in your local repo. Work is done to complete the new feature and git commit is executed to save the changes. You then push the new feature branch to your remote forked repo.

Remember!

You should (github) fork when:

You intend on submitting pull requests back upstream.
The maintainer doesn't like your new feature set, so you decide to add them anyway, and maintain the fork in parallel, routinely merging in changes from upstream as an alternative to the main branch. (Note that you may be required to change the name due to trademark restrictions. I'm not real clear on this.)
You should create a new project when:

When a project is abandoned.
You want to use the project as a starting point for some other project with a completely different goal.
When your version of the project will not be regularly merging in changes from the original, upstream, branch.
But that's honestly just my opinion on the matter.

The other important thing to note here is that both of these are technically "forking" the project. One just remains closer to the original project and utilizes the GitHub feature of the same name.
